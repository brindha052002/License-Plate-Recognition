Problem Statement: License Plate Recognition
Detecting and recognizing vehicle license plates represents a widely recognized challenge that has
garnered significant attention. This challenge revolves around the utilization of two distinct datasets:
1. A collection of vehicle images (totaling 900 images) sourced from the internet and
meticulously annotated. These annotations encompass the precise coordinates of bounding
boxes encapsulating the license plates within each image.
2. An assemblage of license plate images (also amounting to 900 images) where the
annotations take the form of the alphanumeric text inscribed on each license plate.
The primary aim of this task is twofold: first, to identify and locate the license plates affixed to the
vehicles in the images, and second, to perform character recognition on these license plates, deciphering
the alphanumeric text they contain.
